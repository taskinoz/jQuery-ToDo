# jQuery-ToDo
A ToDo list in jQuery with localStorage

## About
This is a minimal client side ToDo list app.

It only stores data using the [window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API.
The browser and nothing is sent to me or any other service.

## Installation
Download the HTML file and put it on any web server, or just run it in the browser.

## Why
I wanted a ToDo list app, but I didn't want to make an account and who knows what people put in free ToDo list apps.
I wanted to experiment with creating editing and storing data objects, and using the localStorage API.

## ToDo
- Add sharing via base64 encoded object
- Fix Webkit styling
- Fix mobile overflow errors with long tasks
(Yes, it is in my ToDo list)
